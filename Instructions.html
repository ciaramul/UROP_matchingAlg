        Scenario
    </h3>

    <p>
        You are in a group of {{Constants.players_per_group}} people.
        Each of the participants in your group will be matched with one of {{Constants.num_sm}}
        slot machines that will deliver a payout of between {{0|c}} and {{ Constants.payout_max|c }}.
        Each round you can select to return to the same slot machine, switch slot machines, or quit the game
        entirely.
    </p>
    <p> On the selection page, you will have {{ Constants.timeout_seconds }} seconds to make your decision.
        If you allow the game to timeout, you will, by default, quit the game.</p>

    <p>This game will be played for {{Constants.num_rounds}} rounds.</p>

    <h4> Returning to the Same Slot Machine</h4>
    <p>
        The same slot machine will fluctuate in payout slightly between rounds, but will return a constant average payout
        while you are accessing it.
    </p>

    <h4> Switching Slot Machines</h4>
    <p>
        If you choose to switch slot machines, you will be matched with one of the {{Constants.num_sm}} slot machines
        in your group that you have not accessed previously and that is not occupied by another member of your group.
    </p>

    <h4> Quitting the Game </h4>
    <p>
        If you elect to quit the game or allow the game to timeout, you will receive a constant amount
        added to your total payout, but will not participate in subsequent rounds.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you choose to quit the first round, you will receive {{Constants.init_quit_pay|c }}.
        For every round you play, this compensation upon quitting will decrease by {{Constants.dec_quit_pay|c}}.
    </p>
